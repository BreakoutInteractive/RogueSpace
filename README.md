# RogueSpace

A lone human crash lands on a mysterious desert world. As they venture from the wreckage, the human is attacked by hostile aliens. The human can defend themselves by parrying an enemy attack or dodging away from harm. They can attack their enemies whenever they gain an opportunity. As the human travels across the planet, the aliens become more challenging to defeat.
